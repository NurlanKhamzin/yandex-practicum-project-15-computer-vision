# 🧑‍🦳 Age Prediction of Customers
Congratulations! You’ve completed the simulator course. Now it’s time to apply your knowledge to a new task — independently.
Once you finish, submit your work for review. You’ll receive feedback within 24 hours. You’ll then need to revise and resubmit your project. You may go through several rounds of revisions — that’s perfectly normal. The project is complete once the reviewer approves all revisions.

## 📘 Project Description
The supermarket chain “Khleb-Sol” is implementing a computer vision system to process customer photos. Photo capture at the checkout area will help estimate customer age in order to:
- Analyze purchases and recommend products relevant to that age group
- Monitor cashier compliance when selling alcohol
Your task is to build a model that estimates a person’s approximate age from a photo. You’re provided with a dataset of photos labeled with age.

## 🛠️ Project Instructions
1. Perform exploratory data analysis on the image dataset
2. Prepare the data for training
3. Train a neural network and evaluate its performance

## ✅ Project Evaluation Criteria
Reviewers will assess:
- Whether all steps in the instructions are completed
- How you conduct exploratory data analysis
- How you prepare the data for training
- Which neural networks you explore
- The quality of your conclusions
- Project structure and code cleanliness

Everything you need is covered in the cheat sheets and course notes.

Good luck! 🚀
